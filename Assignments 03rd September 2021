How to determine an optimal 'k' value, the number of clusters? (given we know the KMeans)
Lets's say we have a hunch of a particular range of number of clusters that will be ideal. 
Let's say it is somewhere between 2 to 20.
Then, run the KMeans clustering with number of clusters as 2,3....20 with an additional function to compare the cost between these clusters.
let's say we use the root mean square method (like used for gas particles in a chamber to derive gas laws) to calculate the sum of costs from centroid in KMeans to all the points in that cluster.
Now we can compare these results. For small values of K the sum/cost will be very high, gas smolecules are too much scattered.
for large values of K the molecules will be too much compacted.
we should target for somwhere in between.
